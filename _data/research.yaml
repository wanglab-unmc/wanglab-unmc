- title: Artificial intelligence and machine learning for medical imaging
  description: In the rapidly-evolving field of medical imaging, I have focused on developing advanced machine learning models and frameworks with medical imaging. Through my work, I have demonstrated the potential of these models to aid in understanding disease mechanisms, as well as in detecting and treating a range of neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders. These models are particularly valuable in identifying brain biomarkers associated with these conditions, which can lead to earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatments. Additionally, I have developed an automatic segmentation algorithm for the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), a key relay center in the visual system. This algorithm has significantly improved the speed and efficiency of research on the visual system, allowing for more comprehensive studies of glaucoma as well as other vision-related diseases. By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, my research has the potential to make a significant impact on the diagnosis and treatment of a range of diseases and disorders, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
